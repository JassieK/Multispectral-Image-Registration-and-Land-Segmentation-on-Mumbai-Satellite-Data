## üóÉÔ∏è About the Data

The dataset used in this project was generously provided by my **undergraduate thesis supervisor**, a former **scientist at DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation)**. This was my **very first hands-on project** with satellite image analysis during my final year of engineering.

The original raw satellite data (8 GB+) was initially in high-resolution format. To enable faster prototyping and lower memory load (especially for student systems), I used JPEG conversions for the first iteration. This trade-off helped me build an end-to-end pipeline for learning and demonstration. However, the workflow can easily be extended to work with raw formats in future applications. 

Each folder (e.g., `1j`, `2j`, `3j`, `4j`) contains:
- 3-band **multispectral images** (Blue, Green, NIR)
- 1-band **panchromatic image**

All images follow the naming pattern:  
`mum_<band>_cropped_<set_number>.jpg`  
where `<band>` = `blu`, `grn`, `nir`, or `pan`.

> üîì **I will be uploading these data folders too, so feel free to explore or test the code with them!**

These images represent real urban areas in Mumbai and allow for a rich analysis pipeline involving image fusion, enhancement, and segmentation ‚Äî just as you'd see in remote sensing or defense-grade research.

## üõ†Ô∏è Objective

This project addresses several key challenges in **satellite image processing** and **urban segmentation** using **multispectral** and **panchromatic** satellite imagery. Specifically, aimed to solve the following:

### 1. **Data Fusion for High-Resolution Imagery**
   - **Problem**: Satellite images often contain multiple spectral bands (e.g., blue, green, red, and infrared), but **panchromatic** images, while offering higher resolution, only capture intensity (grayscale). The challenge was to **combine multispectral images** with the **high-resolution panchromatic image** to create a more detailed, fused image that provides both **rich spectral information** and **high spatial resolution**.
   - **Solution**: I applied an **HSI-based fusion method** to merge the multispectral data with the high-resolution panchromatic image, improving the image's spatial resolution without losing spectral detail.

### 2. **Image Registration and Alignment**
   - **Problem**: Different satellite bands (multispectral vs. panchromatic) often need to be aligned perfectly to enable meaningful analysis. Misalignment can lead to **incorrect analysis** and **poor fusion** results.
   - **Solution**: Using **SIFT feature detection** and **RANSAC** (a robust estimation method), I successfully aligned the multispectral and panchromatic images, ensuring that the final fused image accurately represents the real-world features.

### 3. **Enhancement of Image Quality**
   - **Problem**: The initial fused images often suffer from low contrast and insufficient detail, making it difficult to distinguish subtle features in the landscape (especially for segmentation).
   - **Solution**: I applied **sharpening** and **morphological operations** (such as dilation and erosion) to enhance the fused images, making urban areas and specific features stand out more clearly.

### 4. **Urban Land Segmentation for Resource Management**
   - **Problem**: In urban planning and **resource management**, understanding land usage and classification is crucial. Traditional methods struggle with distinguishing different types of land cover (e.g., urban, vegetation, water) in large cities from satellite images.
   - **Solution**: I used **KMeans clustering** to segment the final enhanced image, grouping pixels into clusters corresponding to **urban areas**, **vegetation**, and **other land features**, providing a clear **land use classification** that can be used for urban planning or environmental analysis.


This project not only showcases a typical remote sensing pipeline but also focuses on solving real-world problems that arise when working with satellite imagery, particularly in urban settings like Mumbai. By combining **image fusion**, **enhancement**, and **segmentation**, I was able to derive valuable insights from the data that could be applied to **urban monitoring**, **resource allocation**, and **environmental studies**.

Each algorithm was selected with consideration for this being a **first real-world remote sensing project**, ensuring a balance between computational efficiency and visual interpretability. The simplicity of the tools (OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn) made it approachable while still achieving a technically rich processing pipeline.

### üîß Custom Enhancement Technique: Fine-Tuning with XOR

As part of the enhancement pipeline, I tried introducing a custom sharpening method using morphological operations and bitwise logic to better emphasize edges and subtle image textures. This step was designed to push beyond standard filters and extract more spatial information relevant for segmentation.

#### üß† What Was done:
- **Morphological Operations**:  
  Firstly computed the **difference between the dilated and eroded** versions of the panchromatic grayscale image. This highlights fine spatial variations and acts like a localized edge detector:
  ```python
  I2 = Dilation - Erosion
  Sharpened = Convolution with [[ 0, -1, 0 ], [-1, 5, -1], [ 0, -1, 0 ]]
  Sharpened = Sharpened | I2
  Final_Enhanced = Sharpened ^ I2
  
Why This Matters:
Traditional enhancement sometimes flattens subtle spatial differences. By creatively combining morphological differencing and XOR logic, I tried emphasizing non-obvious boundaries that proved helpful during unsupervised segmentation.

This tweak demonstrates the experimental approach‚Äîmaking small but meaningful adjustments based on visual inspection and results rather than relying solely on standard procedures.
